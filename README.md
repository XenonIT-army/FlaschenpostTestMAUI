To-Do .net Maui project 

Requirements
Visual Studio 2022
.NET 9

Important Information
This project communicates with an ASP.NET RESTful API server.
Make sure to start the web server before building the project.
The project does not use a local database â€” all data is loaded from the server.
If the app does not start correctly, ensure the web server is running and the connection string is valid.
Default connection strings:
http://10.0.2.2:5000 for Android (can connect to server with http://localhost:5000)
http://localhost:5000 for other platforms
